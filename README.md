# SpinalHDL intro talk code

This repository contains the code for a talk given at the 2023 SpinalHDL
online conference. The talk can be found uploaded on Youtube.
TODO: link once it is uploaded...

It aims to give a quick intro/starting point for new users using a
simple transmitter of signals for WG2812 LEDs as an example.

Note that code in this repository does not reflect best practices.
It is written such that multiple concepts can be presented in a
short time, building on each other.

The presentation can be found in the root folder of the repository.
